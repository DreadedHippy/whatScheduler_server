<p>
	WhatScheduler is an open-source software designed by me, Onotieose Izormen. It started out as a hobby project to aid with performing repetitive tasks on whatsapp but is now a Web application which anyone can use to schedule WhatsApp messages. It was first released on April 19th 2023.
</p>

### How do I use WhatScheduler?

<p>
	To use WhatScheduler, simply create an account at <a href="https://whatscheduler.netlify.app">WhatScheduler's website</a>, verify your email, login, and connect your WhatsApp account by scanning the QRCode displayed. That's it! You're all set.
</p>

### What can i do with WhatScheduler?
<p>
	Currently with WhatScheduler, you can schedule whatsapp messages to send at a later time or send recurring whatsapp messages to any contact or group. You can also send to multiple groups at once.
	There are a lot more features coming soon.
</p>

### Does WhatScheduler read my messages?
<p>
	No, WhatScheduler does not read your messages, Whatsapp currently has no open-source api so WhatScheduler uses wwebjs npm package. This package uses puppeteer under the hood to perform actions on the WhatsApp web interface.
</p>
